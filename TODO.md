# TODO

- test my ideas by introducing an algorithm that infers words from letters
  - signal volume: 0-255
  - signal variance: 0-255 (how much it differs from the average level)
  - duration (ttl) decreasing in time, can be increased on demand
- sensors should generate experiences and introduce them to the temporary memory where it can be refined and analyzed 
  by extracting ideas. Experiences are based on senses (senses are facets of reality)
- dumping the content of working memory at each step of the process
- complete baseform dictionary
- complete morphologic dictionary
